        <section class="desc">
            <p>Alyssa is a dual-degree master's student at the University of Michigan studying at the School of Information 
                with a focus in Digital Curation and at the School for Environment and Sustainability with a focus in Geospatial Data Sciences.</p>

            <p>Her research interests center around characterizing the built and natural environment to aid in community-based solutions for urban 
                sustainability and climate resiliency. She is particularly interested in the access and distribution of greenspace and active transportation 
                as well as the reflection of social ideologies on citizen decision making within urban space.</p>

                    <p>Alyssa analyzed pictorial maps depicting the United States from the 1920-1960s to
                        understand how they reflect and sustain political, economic, cultural, and social dynamics
                        through symbology to identify subtextual narratives related to cultural caricaturization,
                        capitalism and consumerism, American nationalism, enclosure and dispossession of land and exploitation
                        of resources, and segregation in the depiction of labor and leisure activities.</p>
